# Binary Security

This is a landing page for the Binary Security course.
Here you will find all the documentation needed for this course.
It is meant to be used by teachers, trainers, students and hobbyists who want to learn about topics on calculus and statistics.

The course is structured in chapters, each with their own sections.
Each section presents a particular topic, rich in demos, practical content and CTF-like (*Capture the Flag*) challenges.

It is heavily focused on Linux environments and features content similar to what you would find in CTF contents and cybersecurity wargames.

Chapters are:

- Binary Analysis
